# How-To-Github

> **Git** is a free and efficient open source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. 

> **GitHub** was crated in 2008 and is simply an online storage specifically for Git repositories.

## Background

Git simplified collaborating on projects by giving team members the ability to work on files offline, and easily merge changes with the master branch of a project. 

This allowed multiple people to work on the same files at the same time, any suggested changes can be reviewed, before being pushed into the master branch. 

Git repositories (storage locations) could be saved locally on ones computer, or on a central server and shared amongst teams within an organisation.

Git doesn't care about what the contents of a file is, or its file type, it only cares about the differences between different versions of the same file, so it can keep track of them.  

So Git is not just for code development, its for tracking and collaboration of any type of file, from a simple How To document to complex architectural drawings. 

## Why GitHub?

**GitHub** makes it simple for not only people within the same organisation to collaborate, but anyone anywhere in the world.  Team members dont need to be on the same network to be able to collaborate. And of course we dont need to manage servers, storage, backups or the app.  There is also a very large community, so there is a lot of inspiration and support.
